# Death-rate-prediction
The Death rate prediction of the patients who are COVID positive was done
using five different ML algorithms. First, only the COVID-19 positive patients were
selected from the whole dataset then the patients who died was selected from the
dataset. Initially the dataset contained 566,602 data but after the pre-processing of
dataset the remaining data was 32,662. This 32,662 data was trained and tested using
7:3 ratio. Five different ML classifiers: SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest, KNN and
Logistic Regression were used to find how accurately they can predict the patients
who died from COVID-19.
